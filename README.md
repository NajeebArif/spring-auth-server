# Securing Microservices with Spring security and OAuth2

__BETA TESTING:__

## Implement an OAuth2 server to manage user and client credentials

### 1.1: *Configure the token generation*

The current state of the application represents aa authorization server implemented using spring cloud oauth2. 
This authorization server uses asymmetric keys to sign and issue JWT tokens. For the sake of objective 1.1 the client and user details are managed by in-memory implementations
of **ClientDetailsService** and **UserDetailsService**. 

Following the guidelines for the objective 1.1, test cases has been written to validate the token generation for different oauth2 flows.

To validate if the JWT tokens generated by this auth server are properly signed with private key, test case has been written to verify Signature of the generated token 
using the public key from the key pair. Due to this reason the Java-JWT dependency from com.auth0 is added in the test scope.
